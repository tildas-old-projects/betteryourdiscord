# BetterYourDiscord
The Discord CSS overhaul.

# Current code includes:

- Prism theme
- Disccord
- and a few tweaks such as gradient and opacity

# Installing

If you'd like to install BYD, you can import it into a CSS file, using rawgit CDN.

`@import url(https://cdn.rawgit.com/xshotD/betteryourdiscord/master/src/byd.css);`

If you're a developer and want to build (with minify and autoprefixer) you're in luck too!

Simply run these commands:

```
npm install --only=dev
gulp
```

You can find the minified/autoprefixed CSS in the `out` folder.

Further, you can test the gulp code with `npm test`.
